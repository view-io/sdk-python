# Error Handling

The SDK provides comprehensive error handling with specific exception types to help you handle different error scenarios effectively.

## Exception Types

- `AuthenticationError`: Raised when there are issues with authentication credentials
- `AuthorizationError`: Raised when the authenticated user lacks permissions
- `ResourceNotFoundError`: Raised when a requested resource doesn't exist
- `ValidationError`: Raised when input validation fails
- `SdkException`: Base exception class for general SDK errors

## Example Usage

```python
try:
    # Your SDK operations here
    node = view_sdk.configuration.Node.create(
        name="Test Node",
        hostname="test.example.com"
    )
except view_sdk.exceptions.AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
except view_sdk.exceptions.AuthorizationError as e:
    print(f"Authorization failed: {e}")
except view_sdk.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Resource not found: {e}")
except view_sdk.exceptions.ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Validation error: {e}")
except view_sdk.exceptions.SdkException as e:
    print(f"General SDK error: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

1. Always wrap SDK operations in try-except blocks
2. Handle specific exceptions before general ones
3. Log errors appropriately for debugging
4. Clean up resources in finally blocks when necessary
